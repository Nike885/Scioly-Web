# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

Your Scioly App is now ready for deployment to Netlify! Here are all the ways you can deploy it without using GitHub.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Your project is already built and configured
- You have a Netlify account (free at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com))

## 🎯 Quick Deploy (Recommended)

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)

1. **Build your app:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up/login
   - Drag and drop the `web-build` folder to the dashboard
   - Your site will be live in seconds!

### Option 2: Manual Build

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **Build for web:**
   ```bash
   npx expo export:web
   ```

3. **Deploy the `web-build` folder to Netlify**

## 🔧 Advanced Deployment Options

### Option 3: Netlify CLI

1. **Install Netlify CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Build and deploy:**
   ```bash
   npx expo export:web
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=web-build
   ```

### Option 4: Zip Upload

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npx expo export:web
   ```

2. **Zip the web-build folder and upload to Netlify**

## 🌐 Testing Locally

Before deploying, test your build:

```bash
npx expo export:web
npx serve web-build
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your app.

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

Your project includes these deployment-ready files:

- `netlify.toml` - Netlify build configuration
- `public/_redirects` - SPA routing rules
- `webpack.config.js` - Web build optimization
- `deploy.sh` - Automated build script

## 🎨 Customization

### Environment Variables

If you need to set environment variables:
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to Site settings > Environment variables
3. Add your variables (e.g., Supabase URLs)

### Custom Domain

To add a custom domain:
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to Domain management
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Check that the `web-build` folder is generated
- Verify all assets are properly referenced

### Deployment Issues
- Make sure you're uploading the `web-build` folder (not `dist`)
- Check Netlify build logs for errors
- Ensure the `_redirects` file is in the `web-build` folder

### Performance Issues
- The build includes large image assets (officer photos)
- Consider optimizing images for web if needed
- The app will still work fine but may load slower initially

## 📱 Mobile App Compatibility

Your app is configured to work as both:
- ✅ **Web app** (deployed to Netlify)
- ✅ **Mobile app** (ready for App Store/Play Store)

The same codebase supports both platforms with platform-specific optimizations.

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, your Scioly App will be available as a beautiful, responsive web application that works on all devices while maintaining full mobile app functionality for future App Store deployment.
